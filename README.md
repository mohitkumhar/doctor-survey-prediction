# Doctor Surve Pprediction

**Project Description:**  
I have developed a web application to predict the best doctors (NPIs) to invite for a survey based on login data. The app takes a specific time as input and returns a list of doctors (NPIs) most likely to attend the survey at that time. The output is generated as an Excel/CSV file for easy use.  

### **Technologies Used:**
- TensorFlow  
- Scikit-learn  
- Flask  

### **Features:**  
✅ User-friendly interactive UI  
✅ Accepts time input  
✅ Predicts the best doctors to target using AI/ML  
✅ Exports results as Excel/CSV
